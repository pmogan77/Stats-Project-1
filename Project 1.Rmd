## A Data Driven Anime Analysis
**Dataset description**
The anime dataset has a list of anime, synonyms, name in Japanese, name in English, a synopsis, type, number of episodes, current airing status, and the start air date.
We acquired this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harits/anime-database-2022).

The My Anime List dataset has a list of anime, genre, rank, popularity, score, number of episodes, episode length, and release date.
We acquired this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aliibrahim10/anime-ratings).

**Why these datasets?**
While both datasets come from My Anime List, each dataset contains different information web-scraped from the website. Consequently, we hope to combine
both datasets to create a more cohesive picture of each anime and its characteristics.

**Potential relationships**
One potential relationship we expect is that anime with a higher score (rating) tend to also place higher on the popularity list of anime.
In other words, we expect the "best" anime to also be the most watched.

Another relationship we hypothesize is that anime classified as TV will have a higher popularity than movies as they have plots that 
continue to grow and expand over time.

## Importing Datasets
```{r}
# Read both datasets from csv file
setwd("C:/Users/prvn0/Documents/UTClasses/SDS321/Project 1")
anime = read.csv("./Anime.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
MAL_ratings = read.csv("./MALratings.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

## Tidying Datasets
As both datasets are already tidy, we do not need to tidy either of them.
With the anime dataset, we can see that each row represents one observation (anime). 
Furthermore, each variable (title, sysnonyms, synopsis, etc.) has its own column.
Finally, each variable (title, sysnonyms, synopsis, etc.) for each anime has its own, unique cell.

Similarly, with the MAL_ratings dataset, we can see that each row represents one observation (anime). 
Furthermore, each variable (title, popularity, score, etc.) has its own column.
Finally, each variable (title, popularity, score, etc.) for each anime has its own, unique cell.

We will be returning to tidying functions later in the project.
```{r}
# Check that both datasets are tidy
head(anime)
head(MAL_ratings)
```

## Joining Datasets
I joined the two datasets by the title column with an inner join. This means that the anime title must be in both datasets to create a row in the resulting dataset.
This means that anime in one dataset and not in the other will not be recorded in the merged dataset.

There are 21460 rows in the anime dataset.
There are 20343 rows in the MAL_ratings dataset.
There are 20156 rows in the merged dataset.

In other words, 187 rows were dropped from the MAL_ratings dataset and 1304 rows were dropped from the anime dataset.
One issue with the decreased number is that we lose data about anime that only appear in one of the datasets. 
However, there is some added security in that every row within the merged dataset will pull all corresponding information from both original datasets.
This means using inner_join will decrease the number of columns with null values.

The anime dataset has a list of anime, synonyms, name in Japanese, name in English, a synopsis, type, number of episodes, current airing status, and the start air date.
The My Anime List dataset has a list of anime, genre, rank, popularity, score, number of episodes, episode length, and release date.
The merged dataset has an ID, title, synonyms, Japanese name, English name, synopsis, type, episodes.x, status, start_aired, end_aired, premeried, broadcast, producers, licensors, studios, source,
genres.x, themes, demographics, duration_minutes, rating, score.x, scored users, ranked, popularity.x, members, favorites, genres.y, rank, popularity.y, score.y, episodes.y, episode.length, and release date.

The columns in the merged dataset is simply the addition of the anime dataset and the MAL_ratings dataset.
The anime dataset has 28 columns and the MAL_ratings dataset has 8 columns. This creates 36 columns, but since we merged by the title, the resulting dataset has 35 columns.
```{r}
# Determine number of rows in each dataset
anime %>% nrow()
MAL_ratings %>% nrow()

# Determine number of columns in each dataset
str(anime)
str(MAL_ratings)
```

```{r}
# Complete inner join
mergedData = inner_join(anime, MAL_ratings, by="Title")

# Determine number of columns in merged dataset
str(mergedData)

# Determine number of rows in merged datatset
mergedData %>% nrow()
View(mergedData)
```

## Wrangling
One relationship we hypothesize is that anime classified as TV will have a higher popularity than movies as they have plots that 
continue to grow and expand over time.
```{r}
# Determine score by type of show (handles filter, group_by, summarise, arrange) + (categorical summary)
mergedData %>% filter(Type != "Unknown") %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarise(avg_score = mean(Score.x, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% arrange(-avg_score)

# Determine which type of rating has the highest viewership (categorical summary)
mergedData %>% group_by(Rating) %>% summarise(TotalMembers = sum(Members)) %>% arrange(-TotalMembers) %>% slice(1:5)

# Determine popularity of show by episode length (numerical summary)
mergedData %>% group_by(Duration_Minutes) %>% summarise(TotalMembers = sum(Members)) %>% arrange(-TotalMembers) %>% filter(!is.na(Duration_Minutes))

# Determine popularity of show by number of episodes (numerical summary)
mergedData %>% group_by(Episodes.x) %>% summarise(TotalMembers = sum(Members)) %>% arrange(-TotalMembers) %>% filter(!is.na(Episodes.x))

# Used to find total Binge Time (handles mutate and select)
mergedBingeData = mergedData %>% select(ID, Title, Episodes.x, Episodes.y, Duration_Minutes, Members) %>% mutate(TotalBingeTime = Duration_Minutes * Episodes.x)
View(mergedBingeData)

# Determine which total show length has the most members
bingeDataTable = mergedBingeData %>% group_by(TotalBingeTime) %>% summarise(TotalMembers = sum(Members)) %>% arrange(-TotalMembers) %>% filter(!is.na(TotalBingeTime))
kable(x = bingeDataTable %>% slice(1:20))
```

## Visualizations
One potential relationship we expect is that anime with a higher score (rating) tend to also place higher on the popularity list of anime.
In other words, we expect the "best" anime to also be the most watched.
